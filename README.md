# my cs231n project

Hi, my name is Moshe Karl - https://www.linkedin.com/in/moshekarl/

I was a student in the 2nd (annual) class of cs231n local community course organized by the admins of Machine & Deep learning Israel.

This is my capstone project, focused on object tracking.

Main projects goals:
1. Study a leading object tracking model â€“ the MDNet model was selected
2. Develop my own tracking refinement method based on a Deep Neural Network architecture (MDNet still used as base tracking model) 
3. Develop a flexible benchmark (and debugging) framework 

Detailed & guided overview of the project can be found here (it's the last one) - https://machinelearning.co.il/3653/dlcourse-final-2/#more-3653
Or just open the PPT file. 

Note: project was developed under strict timeline, so don't expect the code to be too friendly :)
